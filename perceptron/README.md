# perceptrons

## introduction

Although, deceptively simple - the perceptron is the root of many techniques in machine learning.  It introduces important concepts that are re-purposed in other more sophisticated machine learning techniques including modern-data deep neural networks.  It may be the most basic model of mathematically-based machine learning ever conceived.

The simple perceptron introduces these concepts:

* Input data that must be represented as numeric vectors
* Model weights that can be adaptively changed via a mathematical "learning" process
* A binary "classifier" output
